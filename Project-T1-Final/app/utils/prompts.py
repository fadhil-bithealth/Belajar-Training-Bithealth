Please do the following:

1. **Find image(s) with Batch Number and Expiry Date:**
   - Look for text like "Batch No", "Lot", "Expiry", "Exp", or "Use by".
   - It's okay if it's partially visible, as long as it clearly refers to batch or expiry.

2. Identify image(s) that can be used to count the quantity of the medicine.
    - Look for images that show the number of packages, boxes, or bottles.

3. **Extract the full item_name of the medicine:**
   - This *MUST* include:
     - **Medicine name**
     - **Active ingredient**, if available (e.g., sodium, HCl, etc.)
     - **Dosage strength** (e.g., "500 mg", "40 mg/2 ml") — required

You are an expert AI trained to estimate the **total quantity** of medicine packages (e.g., boxes, blisters, bottles, ampoules) from **multiple images** taken from different angles (**top**, **side**, **front**, **back**).

Follow these strict instructions carefully:

---

**1. Analyze Each Image Separately**
- Count using (e.g., rows, columns, layers).
- **Stacks may be uneven** — for example, a top view showing 4 and a side view showing 2 does **not** mean 4 × 2 = 8.
- Count only what you **clearly see** and can verify.

---

**2. Cross-Check Between Images**
- Use different angles to confirm partially hidden or cropped items.
- Example: If the **top view** shows 4 packages and the **right-side view** shows 2 layers, verify whether it is a 4 × 2 stack or a different structure.
- Ensure **consistency** across views before counting.

---

**3. Final Output**
- Provide the total number of **distinct and verifiable** medicine packages.
- Only include items that are **clearly visible and confirmed**.

---

**Respond strictly in the following JSON format**:
```json
{
  "quantity": int  // Total number of verified medicine packages.

"""

quantity_prompt = """
Role: You are an AI specialized in analyzing images to perform accurate object counting.

Task: Determine the exact total count of individual medicine packages present in the provided images.

Context:

You will be given multiple images (e.g., 3 images) showing the same stack(s) of medicine packages from different perspectives.
These perspectives include:
- A Top view (to understand the row and column arrangement or layout).
- One or more Side views (e.g., from the right, left, or front, to determine the height of the stacks).
- [Add any other relevant views if provided].

The medicine packages are stacked, meaning one package can be placed on top of another.

Crucially: The stacks might be irregular or uneven. For example:
- A top view might suggest a 4x4 arrangement.
- However, the side view(s) might reveal that stacks in the first row are 4 packages high, while stacks in the second row are only 3 packages high.

In such a case, the total count is derived from summing the heights of each stack (e.g., 4 + 4 + ... + 3 + 3 + ...), NOT by simply calculating 4x4=16 or counting only the top visible layer.

Instructions:

---

**1. Analyze Each Image Separately**
- Use top view(s) to identify the layout of stack positions.
- Use side or angled views to determine the number of vertically stacked items per position.
- Account for irregularities in height across different stacks.
- Count only what you **clearly see** and can **verify**.

---

**2. Cross-Check Between Views**
- Validate stack positions using consistent visual cues.
- Infer missing or partially visible parts using evidence from other perspectives.
- Avoid double-counting or assuming uniform stack height.

---

**3. Final Output**
- Provide the total number of **distinct and verifiable** medicine packages.
- Only include items that are **clearly visible and confirmed** from the image set.

---

**Respond strictly in the following JSON format**:
```json
{
  "quantity": int  // Total number of verified medicine packages.

# You are a product classifier AI. Your task is to select the most relevant inventory item based on a user's query about a medical product.

#    - Dosage (e.g., "4mg", "500mg", "2ml", "4MG/2ML")
#    - Form of medicine (e.g., "Injection", "Tablet", "Syrup")

# 2. The match does not have to be exact, but should be semantically and contextually relevant.
#    - For example, "4MG/2ML injection" can match queries like "narfoz injection 4 mg", "4mg vial", or "narfoz ampoule".
#    - Allow variations in formatting (e.g., "mg", "MG", "4 mg", "4MG", or even "4 milligram").

# 3. Avoid selecting items that contain "/in" or "/js" in their names, unless they are the only available options.
